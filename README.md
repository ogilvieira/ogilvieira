# Hello 👋

I have worked at advertising and marketing agencies, on white-label solutions, gambling platforms, and mobile applications, as well as contributing to the community through plugins for Node and Dart. I hold a degree in Internet Systems from Senac São Paulo and a postgraduate qualification in Cloud Computing, with English at the B2 level.

I am pragmatic and results-oriented, creating solutions that reduce costs and increase efficiency. I value teamwork, share knowledge as a mentor, and am always open to learning.

My distinguishing feature is combining strategic vision, hands-on execution, and creativity in problem-solving, consistently contributing to the growth of both the team and the projects.
